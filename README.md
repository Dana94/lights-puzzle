# Lights Puzzle

> A grid game based on the lights puzzles on [Khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math-for-fun-and-glory/puzzles/lights-puzzles/e/lights-puzzles-2). You have 3 levels of difficulty to choose from.

The game can be solely accessed through the keyboard alone.

:warning: I strongly encourage you to only view this project on a computer because the larger puzzles will be too big to display well in mobile.
